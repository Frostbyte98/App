# Bounce
Bounce is a game where the main goal for each player is to gain the best score on an online leaderboard (one per each level).
In each level there will be 4 different types of blocks/balls (blue, red, purple and green) each one with a different score.
Each level needs to be completed to gain access to the next one and in order to complete it you have to hit all red blocks/balls. In addiction per each shoot you must hit at least one red block/ball otherwise you'll get a 15% malus.
In order to make it easier to play for everyone the game offers a colour blind mode that enables different symbols on the blocks/balls.
Thinking to the future of this game we want to share some features that are not implemented yet:
character selection (each character will have a special power that you can enable in game hitting a green block/ball); more levels; turn-based multiplayer mode.
